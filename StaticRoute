Router with two connected networks can route automatically.
(connected networks (no shutdown only) ,static routes,default routes,dynamic routes)
! static route (remote networks)-> ingress interface , egress interface 
#ip route (destination address) (subnet mask)  (next hop)
! default route ( 2 ways )
! to send traffic to any network not found in the routing table to (establish a gateway of last resort for your router)
#ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 (next hop or interface) 
! any traffic destined for networks not found in the routing table will be sent to the default network.
#ip default route (network address)
or 
#default-information originate (Rip,EIGRP,OSPF)-> can propagate this default network to other routers
! floating static route (backup)
#ip route (destination address) (subnet mask)  (next hop) (distance)
! Dynamic Routes : routers tells each other about their connected networks.
! best path according to Administrative distance and Metric
! the lowest AD is the best for chosing the path
! Connected 0
! Static 1
! RIPv1,2 120 / hop count
! OSPF 110 / Cost
! EIGRP (internal) 90 / feasible distance
! EIGRP (external) 170 / feasible distance
! The main factor in deciding the best path is routing protocol's metric(algorithm)
