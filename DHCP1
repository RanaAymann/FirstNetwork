! DHCP in a routed world
! DHCP 2 ways ( router(server {pool+excluded addresses}),
! switch{router assign Relay{helper address}).
! options the DHCP server assigns subnet mask,router(gateway),DNS server.. and more.
! clients usually perfer the same IP address
! a host sends a broadcast msg to the switch saying i need an IP only the DHCP server will respond will offer msg.
