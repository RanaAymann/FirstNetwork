! if i'm not using interface assign it no ip address and shutdown.
! PAT :multiple inside local IP addresses are translated to single inside global IP address,
! with multiple translations to the same IP distinguished by random source port selection.
! overload turns on PAT
! NAT (static,Pool,PAT)
! static NAT(host reach mail,web servers): one-to-one mapping of an inside local IP to an inside global IP.
! it does not conserve the ip addresses at all.
#ip nat inside source static <inside-local-ip> <inside-global-ip>
! then assign the inside and outside interfaces
#int <>
#ip nat inside
#int <>
#ip nat outside


! pool: a group of addresses that are available for translation
#ip nat pool <pool-name> <first-ip> <last-ip> netmask <mask>

! assign PCs ip address using dhcp

! ISP will block RFC 1918 addresses(private addresses) NAT will translate them and replace them with puplic ip address.
! 3 steps
! 1-ACL to IP addresses to be translated
! 2-identify the inside and and outside interface
! 3-define nat operations

#ip access-list standard NAT_ADDRESSES 
#permit 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255
#exit

#show ip int brief (to know which interface is inside and outside)
#int f0/0
#ip nat inside 
#exit

#int f0/1
#ip nat outside 
#exit

! in global mode
Router(config)#ip nat inside list NAT_ADDRESSES interface f0/1 overload
! overload (means to use PAT)
#show ip nat translation

! Overloaded NAT Pool 
! buy IPs from ISP 

Router(config)#ip nat pool (name) (start address) (last address) perfix-length (CIDR) 
or
Router(config)#ip nat pool (name) (start address) (last address) subnet mask  
Router(config)#ip nat inside list NAT_ADDRESSES pool (name) overload
