--> Bridging and Switches (Filter,forward,flood)
(Trunking and VTP)
Create VlANs (ip agonstic don't understand IPs)
! create mutliple broadcast domains,subnets,networks.
! extend layer 2 fabric and segment,isolate traffic.
! Moving between VLANs-> Router on a stick.
#vlan 10
#name HR
#spanning-tree portfast (prevent BPDU)
#exit
#erase startup-config
#delete flash:valn.dat
#reload
Assigning VLANs
#int f0/0
#switchport access vlan 10
#exit 
(Switchport modes-> access,trunk,dynamic auto,dynamic desirable)
! access: DTP frames are not sent or ack
! trunk: DTP frames are sent,but the received trunk will only form it a request is received from the other switch.
! dynamic auto: only in response to a DTP request to do so.(receive DTP only)
! dynamic desirable: (default) DTP are send and received.
#int f0/0
#switchport mode Off
#switchport nonegotiate /disable DTP/
or
#switchport trunk allowed VLAN ... ( will avoid some vlans,but trunk allow all vlans by default)
exit
#switchport native vlan 1 (default)-> change it for security.
(Trunk mode)
#int f0/0
#switchport mode trunk
#switchport trunk encapsulation (is1 , dot1q , negotiate )

(VTP)-> client (only puts the database in it) ,server (will take the VLANs) , trasparent (VTP disable)
! is not a trunking protocol ( replicates VLANs) ,conforms the network so i'll assign the VLANs on each switch.
! Also it's sequential ( VTP REV #0 )
#show VTP status
#Vtp mode server
#Vtp domain Nuggets ( all switches operating VTP server or client must have the same domain name)
#Vtp password cisco
#vtp v2-mode
#vtp pruning (server mode)
#switchport trunk pruning vlan remove 3,20-30
! remove vlan 3 and 20-30
#switchport trunk pruning vlan except 40-50
! All VlANs are added to the pruning list except for 40-50

#show vtp status
#show vtp counters
#clear counters
